# Programmable Potentiometer
This repository has the library and example code of an Arduino compatible Programmable Potentiometer.
The library is a wrapper class of the class developed by Adafruit Industries. The main distinction is that most hash defines and constants were made automatically in side our library. Additionally, you can program an instance of this class to read the wiper pin value from a pin of your choice.
